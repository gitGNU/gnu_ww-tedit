WW is a programmer's text editor. It features small
memory and disk requirements, syntax highlighting, multiple simultaneous file
editing, and more. It can be compiled for Linux / Unix (text console), and
GUI emulated console for X and MS Windows.


====== Build for Windows

Open a cmd.exe prompt. To setup the command line envyronment, execute
vcvars32.bat from msdev\bin.

Create directoriy for the debug binaries, ww_guiemu_dbg. Make it current
so that the source is in ../src. From there execute

`cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..'

This creates makefile for nmake. To build after that, only type `nmake'.


====== Build for Linux

Create directoriy for the debug binaries, ww_ncurs_dbg. Make it current
so that the source is in ../src. From there execute

`cmake -G  "Unix Makefiles" ..'

This creates makefile for GNU make. To build after that, only type `make'.


====== Doxygen

`Doxyfile' is the configuration for Doxygen. Inside 'Doxyfile' search for
`# *' to find all marked comment sections of the options that were changed
from the default.

To generate the documentation from within the top directory, so that src is
a subdirectory of the current directory, execute:

`doxygen'

API documentation of the modules is generated in doxy/html.


====== Prepare ChangeLog:
cvs2cl.pl --fsf


====== Tips for using WW in a text terminal

There are different levels of limitations depending on the terminal emulation
The best terminal emulation is xterm, it transmits most of the useful key
combinations. Every other terminal is with varying degree of limitations.

-- If Alt combinations doesn't work, use ESC to invoke menu, then
   two or three shortcut letter. For example search function is `Esc,s,u'
-- Ctrl+tab doesn't work, use Ctrl+F6 to switch between the top two files
-- To switch among other files use atl+0 or Alt+W
-- If ctrl+F6 doesn't work, use the equivalent `Alt+W,2'
-- Shift+arrors must work in xterm, if it doesn't then use F8
-- `Ctrl+K,b', `Ctrl+k,k' also works for selections
-- Ctrl+Shift+F8 must work to switch to column blocks, if it doesn't
   then use `Ctrl+k,n'
-- To indent blocks use Tab as usual, to unindent use Ctrl+k-u
