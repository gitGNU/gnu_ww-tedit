WW is a programmer's text editor. It features small
memory and disk requirements, syntax highlighting, multiple simultaneous file
editing, and more. It can be compiled for Linux / Unix (text console), and
GUI emulated console for X and MS Windows.

How to build for Windows
------------------------
Open a cmd.exe prompt. To setup the command line envyronment, execute
vcvars32.bat from msdev\bin.

Create directoriy for the debug binaries, ww_guiemu_dbg. Make it current
so that the source is in ../src. From there execute

`cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..'

This creates makefile for nmake. To build after that, only type `nmake'.


How to build for Linux
----------------------
Create directoriy for the debug binaries, ww_ncurs_dbg. Make it current
so that the source is in ../src. From there execute

`cmake -G  "Unix Makefiles" ..'

This creates makefile for GNU make. To build after that, only type `make'.


How to build Doxygen documentation
----------------------------------
`Doxyfile' is the configuration for Doxygen. Inside 'Doxyfile' search for
`# *' to find all marked comment sections of the options that were changed
from the default.

To generate the documentation from within the top directory, so that src is
a subdirectory of the current directory, execute:

`doxygen'

API documentation of the modules is generated in doxy/html.


Tips for using WW in a text terminal
------------------------------------
When running WW in a text terminal most of the CUI key combinations are not
working. For example, the arrow keys work everywhere but on many terminals the shift+arrow combination doesn't emit any distinctive key sequence rendering many editor functions unaccessible. Alternative set of key bindings can be used to invoke those unreachable functions.

Frequently used editor functions are assigned to 'ctrl' combinations.

ctrl+e -- enters text selection mode. The current cursor position is marked as one end of the selection and the arrow keys will extend the range by moving the position of the other end.  After that any block
manipulation operation will use the current selection and will also
end the mode. For example, to copy text, start with ctrl+e,
use arrows to select, and to copy press ctrl+c, this will put the text in the
clipboard and at the same time end the selection mode.

ctrl+d, e -- toggle column block mode

ctrl+l -- find next. A substitute to F3 which doesn't work on some terminals.
ctrl+d, l -- search backward. Substitute for shift+F3.
ctrl+d, i -- incremental search mode

ctrl+d, left -- previous word, substitute for ctrl+left-arrow
ctrl+d, right -- next word, subsitute for ctrl+right-arrow
ctrl+d, ctrl+left/right also works. This is convenient in to make cursor jump over a few words in the same direction -- the operation can be executed without releasing the `ctrl' key.

ctrl+d, home -- top of file, substitute for ctrl+home
ctrl+d, end -- bottom of file, subtitute for ctrl+end

ctrl+b, b -- set/remove a bookmark
ctrl+b, up -- go to previous bookmarks
ctrl+b, down -- go to next bookmark

(old:TODO:edit:some suggestions are still valid)

There are different levels of limitations depending on the terminal emulation
The best terminal emulation is xterm, it transmits most of the useful key
combinations. Every other terminal is with varying degree of limitations.

-- If Alt combinations doesn't work, use ESC to invoke menu, then
   two or three shortcut letter. For example search function is `Esc,s,u'
-- Ctrl+tab doesn't work, use Ctrl+F6 to switch between the top two files
-- To switch among other files use atl+0 or Alt+W
-- If ctrl+F6 doesn't work, use the equivalent `Alt+W,2'
-- Shift+arrors must work in xterm, if it doesn't then use F8
-- `Ctrl+K,b', `Ctrl+k,k' also works for selections
-- Ctrl+Shift+F8 must work to switch to column blocks, if it doesn't
   then use `Ctrl+k,n'
-- To indent blocks use Tab as usual, to unindent use Ctrl+k-u


How to extend the table of terminal key sequences
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The editor has quite complete set of key sequences already. But once in a while
there is a terminal that emits sequences that are not in the ncurs_disp.c file. New entries can be easilly added to the s_keys[] table.

First the actual sequence must be obtained. There is a convenient script, keys.pl, which can be downloaded from here:
http://geocities.com/h2428/petar/bash_bind.htm

Press the new keys while the script is running. For example, the discovery of what are the key sequences for `home' and `end' on putty will look like this:

$ ./keys.pl
press 'x' to exit
\x1b\x5b\x31\x7e
\x1b\x5b\x34\x7e
restore console mode

Now these two lines can be added to s_keys[]:
{"\x1b\x5b\x31\x7e", KEY(0, kbHome)},
{"\x1b\x5b\x34\x7e", KEY(0, kbEnd)},

After a rebuild these `home' and `end' will work on putty.


TODO
----
SHORT-TERM:
* handle resize signal for ncurses
* remove most of VALIDATE_HEAP_PTR and VALIDATE_HEAP, which were put temporarely
* highlight pairs of () and []
* ctrl+] : goto matching pair
* ctrl+[ : goto to the { or current level - 1
* Indent/Unindent block should work even if block is hidden
* in X Read fron from the .ini, like in the Windows GUI
* in gui_scr and x_scr and elsewhere fix the buf[255] to be bigger/smarter!
* ini2.c, when writing .ini files, check that no section is written
  if no changes were made on any of the options; this is necessary to permit
  for more than one editor to store .ini files on exit
* when resizing the screen make the file status line show the width and
  the height of the file area, the format should be WxH instead of
  row:col
* prepare native palette for text console in putty, redo the way palettes
  are maintained to permit italics and bolds for comments and highlights
* add the thwrap multithread library
* refactor display and keyboard into separate module (library)
* EVENT_KEY is too big, move out from HandleFileViewEvents (fview.c)
* establish min size (use MSG_SET_MIN_SIZE)

IDEAS:
* in the .ini file add section to permit the adding of
  new ESC sequences
* Pressing <End> twice will show the current func name tooltip if not
  currently visible on the screen
* Think of highlighting TABS
* Think of highlighting SPACES at the end of the lines
* make ctrl+kz -- suspend (unix suspend), this when suspend is implemented
* ini2.c -- merge histories of files and ed lines based on a time stamp,
  this will permit that upon exit multiple editor instances would not
  overwrite eachothers data blindly
