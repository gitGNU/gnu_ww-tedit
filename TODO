SHORT-TERM:
* highlight pairs of () and []
* ctrl+] : goto matching pair
* ctrl+[ : goto to the { or current level - 1
* Indent/Unindent block should work even if block is hidden
* in gui_scr and x_scr and elsewhere fix the buf[255] to be bigger/smarter!
* ini2.c, when writing .ini files, check that no section is written
  if no changes were made on any of the options; this is necessary to permit
  for more than one editor to store .ini files on exit
* when resizing the screen make the file status line show the width and
  the height of the file area, the format should be WxH instead of
  row:col
* add the thwrap multithread library
* EVENT_KEY is too big, move out from HandleFileViewEvents (fview.c)
* establish min size (use MSG_SET_MIN_SIZE)
* gui_scr, scr_realloc_buf must handle case of no memory!
* x_scr, disp_realloc_buf must handle case of no memory,
  allocate new buf then free old one!
* refactor display and keyboard into separate module (library)
* remove TCharInfo macros as part of the refactoring
* prepare native palette for text console in putty, redo the way palettes
  are maintained to permit italics and bolds for comments and highlights


IDEAS:
* in the .ini file add section to permit the adding of
  new ESC sequences
* Pressing <End> twice will show the current func name tooltip if not
  currently visible on the screen
* Think of highlighting TABS
* Think of highlighting SPACES at the end of the lines
* make ctrl+kz -- suspend (unix suspend), this when suspend is implemented
* ini2.c -- merge histories of files and ed lines based on a time stamp,
  this will permit that upon exit multiple editor instances would not
  overwrite eachothers data blindly
